    "\n",
    "The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made in several markets in Brazil. This is real commercial data, it has been anonymized.\n",
    "This dataset is generously provided by Olist, the largest department store on the Brazilian market. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to the channel without any hassle and with one contract. The merchant can sell their products through the Olist Store and have them shipped directly to the customer using the Olist logistics partner. Once the customer purchases the product from the Olist Store, the seller will be notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey via email where he or she can provide a note for the purchase experience and some comments."
